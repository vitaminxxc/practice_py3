## Task 1: Factorial Using Function and Loop/Recursion

### Problem Statement:

Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a **loop** or **recursion**.  
2. Returns the calculated factorial.  
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.


# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement:

Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.  
2. Uses the `math` module to calculate the:
   - Square root of the number  
   - Natural logarithm (log base *e*) of the number  
   - Sine of the number (in radians)  
3. Displays the calculated results.
